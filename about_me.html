        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>
            Hey! My name is <b>Adi Roitburg</b>. I'm a computer science major AND game design / animation minor at Loyola Marymount University. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I was born in Israel, then moved to Seattle a couple years later.            
        </p>

        <p>
            I grew up with a love for video games. Some of my favorite games from my childhood included Super Mario, Plants Vs Zombies, Pokemon Black, and Destiny.
            My interest in video games further developed as I grew up, now becoming interested in creating games.
        </p>

        <p>
            While I am still interested in making video games, I also became interested in other fields in computer science, such as <b>UX Design </b> and <b> Machine Learning</b>.           
        </p>

        <p>
            Other than computer science stuff, I enjoy playing tennis, bouldering, music, and video editing!
        </p>
